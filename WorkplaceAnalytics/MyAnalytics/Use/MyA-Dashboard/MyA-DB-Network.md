## Network 

The My network section of the MyAnalytics dashboard shows how you spent your time with the people and groups you interact with in meetings or in email.  

By default, this chart displays all of your collaborators. A blue star next to a contact indicates that this person is on your list of Important people. 

For each contact, the following metrics are displayed to the side of the network diagram, under the label _Last week collaboration_. 

#### Total time

Total time you spend with the contact over the past week, based on meetings and emails

#### Meeting time

Time you spent in meetings with the contact over the past week. 

> [!Note]
> Meetings that have more than 12 participants are excluded.

#### Read percent

Percentage of contact's emails that you read

#### Response time

The average time it takes you to respond to the contact's email

#### 1:1 meetings

Time you spent in one-on-one meetings with the contact over the past week

**To change views or filter contacts**

You can view your network data in a map view or a list view. To switch between views, select **Map** or **List**. In either view, you can filter your contacts by selecting "Important" or "Groups." 

"Total time" represents the sum of the meeting time you’ve had with the contact and the time you’ve spent in email with that contact. 

**To see your time with a specific contact** 

Click a name in the chart to see an overview of your time with a specific person or group. The right side of your network chart displays statistics about your interactions with the contact. From this view, add or remove people from your important people list by clicking the star under their name.
